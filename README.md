# NY-Bicycle-Sharing-Demand-Analysis
This project is about making analysis and prediction for New York city bike sharing demand. I used XGBoost to predict the demand and 
present it with streamlit.io. 

The streamlit presentation is multi-paged and you can access it with the Home.py as the main page and the other pages inside the pages folder
